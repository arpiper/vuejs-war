###Gameplay

This two player game is played using a standard 52-card deck. The objective of the game is to win all the cards. The deck is divided evenly among the players, giving each a deck of face-down cards. In unison, each player reveals the top card of their deck – this is a battle – and the player with the higher card adds both cards to the bottom of their deck. If the cards are of equal value, it's war!
This process is repeated until one player runs out of cards, at which point the other player is declared the winner.
####War

Both players place their next three cards face down, then a card face-up. The owner of the higher face-up card wins the war and adds all cards on the table to the bottom of their deck. If the face-up cards are again equal then the war repeats with another set of face-down/up cards, until one player's face-up card is higher than their opponent's, or both players run out of cards
If, when a war begins
either player does not have enough cards for the war, both players reduce the number of cards to allow the war to complete (e.g. if P2 has only three cards remaining, both players play two cards down and one card up. If P2 has only one card remaining, no cards are played face-down and each player only plays one card up).
either player has no cards remaining, the other player wins.
both players have no cards remaining, the game is a draw (this is exceptionally rare in random games).
####Post-battle/war

For consistency (so we all end up with the same result for the same input), cards used in a battle or war should be added to the bottom of the winner's deck in a particular order.
After a battle, the winner's card is added to the bottom the winner's deck first, then the loser's card.
After a war or wars, cards used in the war(s) are added to the deck first, followed by the two tying cards. "Cards used in the war(s)" is defined as follows:
1. Cards from any sub-wars (recursive, using this ordering)
2. Winner's face-down cards (in the order they were drawn, first card draw is first added to bottom, etc)
3. Winner's face-up card
4. Loser's face-down cards (in the order they were drawn, first card draw is first added to bottom, etc)
5. Loser's face-up card
